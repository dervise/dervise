## Welcome to my GitHub profile! ð“…­ ð“…° ð“…­ ð“…° ð“…­

I have always been fascinated by the ever-evolving world of technology and the challenges it brings. My curiosity in understanding the inner workings of computer systems and networks led me to pursue a career in **cyber security**. I have a strong desire to learn about new security threats and to come up with innovative solutions to protect against them.

In addition to cyber security, I have a keen interest in other areas of IT, including **programming, software development, and database management**. I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks and experimenting with different technologies to solve complex problems.
